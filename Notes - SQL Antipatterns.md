# SQL Antipatterns: Avoiding the pitfalls of database programming

What is an antipattern? is simply a technique used to solve some problem, that often leads to another problem, maybe harder to solve than the first one. Frequently an antipattern is also a mistep when solving a problem.

## Logical Database Design Antipatterns

They are antipatterns that appears when we deciding what data we do need to put in our databases, and how we organize this data.

## Physical Database Design Antipatterns

Physical database design antipatterns are concerned to how implement the data management as efficiently as possible - including tables, indexes, and so on.

## Query Antipatterns

These treat how you add data to your database, and how do you retrieve this data from it.

## Application Development Antipatterns

Are simply right and wrong ways to employ SQL in an application.

## Rules of Normalization

Many of the antipatterns are the results of misundertanding concepts of database theory, here we have some studies on these misunderstood topics.
