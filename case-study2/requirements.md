# Case study 2 - Requirements

The owners of a small computer repair shop would like to keep track of the repair jobs for computers they repair, the items used for each repair job, the labor costs for each repair job, the repairmen performing each repair job, and the total cost of each repair job.

When customers bring their computers in to be repaired, they make a deposit on the repair job and are given a date to return and uplift their computer. Repairmen then perform repairs on the customers' computers based on the repair job, and detail the labor costs and the items used for each repair job.

When customers return they pay the total cost of the repair job less the deposit, collect a receipt for their payment, and uplift the repaired computer using this payment receipt.
