# Database Design Course 

This repository is holding the files of my Database design studies, this studies were based on the book "Six-Step Relational Database Design" by Fidel Captain and SQL Antipatterns: Avoiding the pitfalls of database programming by Bill Karwin. The first, as the subtitle says, is a step-by-step approach to relational database design and development, and the second one is a guide on how to keep good practices while programming databases. This repository is also used to hold my studies using PostgreSQL, including notes and examples that were eventually implemented.
