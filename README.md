# Database Design Course 

This repository is holding the files of my Database design studies using sqlite. My studies are based on the book "Six-Step Relational Database Design" by Fidel Captain and SQL Antipatterns: Avoiding the pitfalls of database programming. The first, as the subtitle says, is a step-by-step approach to relational database design and development, and the second one is a guide on how to keep good practices while programming databases.

**Important**: The book's examples and exercises were coded in MySQL, although in this repository the exercises and the examples are coded in sqLite.
