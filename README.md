# Database Design Course 

This repository is holding the files of my Database design studies using sqlite. My studies are based on the book "Six-Step Relational Database Design" by Fidel Captain. As the subtitle says this book is a step by step approach to relational database design and development.

**Important**: The book's examples and exercises were coded in MySQL, although in this repository the exercises and the examples are coded in sqLite.
