# Case study 3 - Small college

## Requirements

The registrar at a small college wants an application that will help their department keep track of the scheduled classes, the courses and lecturers appearing in the schedule, and the students registering for courses according to the schedule. 

Courses are scheduled every semester and this is documented in the schedule of classes, which also documents the lecturers assigned to each scheduled class. Students register for courses according to the list of scheduled classes. 

Users (students, lecturers, and other college staff) must login to the application to gain access, and the application must keep track of user logins/logouts. In addition, users must have different levels of access, which will determine their access to different parts of the application.
